== Bias-Free language

The documentation set for this project strives to use bias-free language. For the
purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does
not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic
identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality.
Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded
in the user interfaces of the project software, language used based on RFP
documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.
